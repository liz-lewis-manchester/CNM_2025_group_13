**Project Milestones**
-

This document gives the milestones and tasks used to complete the *Coursework: Modelling Pollutant Transport in a River*.

*Milestone 1:...*
-
- Goal: Set up domain and variables 
- Task 1: Model domain and initialisation of grid
- Task 2: Splitting matrix into coefficient A and B
- Task 3: Forward substitution solver
- Deliverables: Function to initialise grid; coefficients A and B; function to solve the substitution
- Person Responsible for checking: Zina Almazloum


*Milestone 2:...*
- 
- Goal: Handle data for testing
- Task 4: Create boundary condition
- Task 5: Reading initial_conditions.csv
- Task 6: Interpolating initial condition with model grid
- Deliverables: Inflow and outflow boundary; function to load file and interpolate it 
- Person Responsible for checking: William Gardiner

*Milestone 3:Simulations*
-
- Goal: Run simulations to verify the usefulness of the code
- Task 7: Baseline simulation (Test case 1 from Coursework Brief)
- Task 8: Simulation with the initial conditions are read in from a csv file ‘initial_conditions.csv (Test case 2 from Coursework Brief)
- Deliverables: Results folder with plots from Task 7 and Task 8
- Person responsible for checking: Kataryna Santana

*Milestone 4:...*

- Task 10: Exponetial decay in time (Test case 4 from Coursework Brief)
- Task 11: Variable stream velocity profile (Test case 5 from Coursework Brief)
- Deliverables: Results folder with plots from Task 9, Task 10 and Task 11
- Person responsible for checking: Muhammad Ramlee

*Milestone 5:...*
-
- Goal: Check testing, documentation, and visualisation to finalise the coursework
- Task 12: Visualisation tools
- Task 13: Automated tests
- Deliverables: Visualisation tools saved into 'Results' folder; finalise Readme file and check if everythig works properly and it done.
